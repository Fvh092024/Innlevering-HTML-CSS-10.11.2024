              Jupiter, a place of colossal storms, deadly radiation, and
              captivating beauty. A powerhouse whose mass is so great, it
              influences even the sun itself. Jupiter is fast becoming one of
              the most studied objects in our solar system - with 7 flybys, two
              orbiters (with one still in operation today) and two additional
              planned missions. The cosmic vacuum cleaner, Jupiter holds a vital
              role in protecting the earth from the incoming barrage of
              interstellar meteorites. The fifth planet from the sun, Jupiter is
              found on the outskirts of the asteroid belt, and sits between the
              orbits of Mars and Saturn. It is 778 million kilometers away from
              the sun on average, or 5.2 astronomical units, which means it's
              5.2 times further from the sun than the earth's orbit from the
              sun. It completes a full orbit every 12 earth years. It is a
              massive planet, the largest in our solar system. It is so massive,
              its mass is 1/1000 that of the sun. That might not seem like a
              lot, but once you realize the sun contains 99.86% of all the mass
              in the solar system, you'll realize that Jupiter equals almost the
              remainder. Its mass is 2.5x the rest of the planets combined.
              Jupiter has 95 recognized moons, 4 of which (The Galilean moons)
              we’ll touch on briefly.

            <p class="io-text">
              Io is one of the most curious objects in our solar system. The
              innermost of Jupiter's big moons, it has plenty of features that
              sets it apart from anything else that we have ever seen, including
              volcanoes, aurorae, and a sulfur atmosphere. Io orbits very close
              to Jupiter, only 350 000 kilometers above Jupiter's cloud tops.
              This means that from Io's surface, Jupiter would appear 39 times
              bigger in the sky than our moon. Its orbit is in sync with two of
              the other Galilean moons, it orbits twice for every orbit of
              Europa, and 4 times for every orbit of Ganymede. This is what we
              call an orbital resonnance. Io is a pretty big moon, although it
              is the second smallest out of the Galilean moons. It is comparible
              in size to our own moon, and shares a similar density, meaning it
              has a similar amount of gravity. Io is volcanically active, and it
              is still the first and only place this has been visibly seen
              beyond earth. Its core is likely to be made of iron or iron
              sulfides, surrounded by a silicate rich mantle and crust. The core
              is not thought to be convecting them, as no magnetosphere has been
              detected around the moon.

            <p class="europa-text">
              Europa is the second and the smallest of the four Galilean moons,
              although it's still the sixth biggest moon in the entire solar
              system, just behind earths moon, with a diameter 90% that of our
              moon's. It takes Europa 3.5 days to orbit Jupiter once, twice as
              long as Io. Jupiters gravitational forces have a significant
              influence of the moons appearance, and what goes on under the
              surface. Europas surface is made predominantly of water ice. It
              looks very remarkable and distinctive due to its long, continous
              fractures and cracks. Despite being roughly the age of the solar
              system, Europa barely has any craters. It has less than 50 major
              craters, whereas earths moon has more than 5000 craters with a
              diameter of more than 25 kilometers. This indicates that Europas
              surface is constantly changing and reforming. Its icy surface is
              the smoothest surface of any known solid celestial object in the
              entire solar system. It is believed to host a body of water even
              bigger than our own. NASA’s Europa Clipper probe was launched on
              October 14th of this year. Its mission is to survey these oceans,
              scouting for potential life.

              Ganymede, the third of Jupiters Galilean moons, and the largest
              moon that we know of. Like Europa, Ganymedes surface is a thick
              crust of water ice, extending 150 kilometers deep, underneath
              which is believed to lie a vast ocean of liquid water. The
              abundance of water on Ganymede reduces its average density. The
              ocean of Ganymede is so big that it contains more water than all
              the oceans and seas on Earth, and it's estimated to be 100
              kilometers in depth on average, 10 times deeper than the Mariana
              Trench. All of this water means that Ganymede is only 50% rock,
              the rest being water and small amounts of metals and other ices.
              Interestingly, Ganymede has an atmosphere that contains oxygen.
              Now you might be wondering, with all this water and an oxygen
              atmosphere, is it possible that life exists on Ganymede? While
              it's certainly possible, there are some features of Ganymede that
              make this unlikely. The oxygen atmosphere is very thin. It is
              estimated to be 100 billion-500 billion times less than Earth's
              atmospheric pressure at sea level.

            <p class="callisto-text">
              Callisto is the third largest moon in the entire solar system,
              it's just smaller than Mercury at 4820km across, compared to
              Mercury's 4879. However, while its diameter is only 59 kilometers
              less than Mercury's, it's only 1/3rd of the planet's mass, meaning
              it's less dense and its gravity is a lot weaker. It's the second
              largest Galilean moon, and orbits much farther out than the other
              three, taking 17 days to do so at an average distance of 1.9
              million kilometers. Even at this distance, it is still tidally
              locked to Jupiter, meaning the same side of the moon always faces
              its parent planet. Callisto has a very tenuous atmosphere composed
              of carbon dioxide. Its surface is one of the most ancient in the
              solar system, with evidence placing it at over 4 billion years
              old. You'll immediately notice the specled nature of Callisto, its
              surface is completely covered with various sized impact craters,
              more so than any other object we've observed. In fact, it's close
              to saturation, any new crater will probably just overlap another
              one at this point. Without any geological activity, cratering is
              perhaps the only process that has vastly been impacting Callisto's
              appearance over its lifetime.

            <p class="saturn-text">
              Saturn is big. It's a gas giant with an average radius about 9x
              that of Earth, making it the second biggest planet in our solar
              system. I say average radius, because its equatorial and polar
              radii differ by almost 10%. It's 60 000 kilometers at the equator,
              compared to 54 000 kilometers from pole to pole. With an average
              density of about 0.7g/cm^3, it is only 1/8 the average density of
              Earth. However, because its volume is so large, Saturn's mass is
              over 95 earths. This low density makes Saturn the lightest planet
              per cubic unit by far, and it is the only planet in the solar
              system that's less dense than water, about 30% less. So. if you
              had a bath toy of Saturn that shares the same density as the
              planet, it would float! Its yellow hue is believed to be due to
              ammonia crystals in the upper atmosphere. The rings are one of the
              highlights of the planet. Saturn has a prominent ring system that
              consists of 10 continuous main rings. They extend from 67 000
              kilometers to 140 000 kilometers above Saturn's center. They're
              made up mostly of water ice, with small amounts of dust and rocks.
              While Saturn has 146 known moons, the only one we’ll take a look
              at this time will be Titan, one of the most intriguing bodies in
              the entire solar system.

            <p class="titan-text">
              Titan is Saturn’s largest moon and the second-largest in the solar
              system. It is unique due to its thick, nitrogen-rich atmosphere,
              which is mostly composed of nitrogen with traces of methane and
              other organic compounds. This dense atmosphere, combined with its
              cold surface temperature of around -179°C, makes Titan resemble an
              early version of Earth, with possible analogs for early life.
              Titan’s surface features large seas and lakes of liquid methane
              and ethane, with vast sand dunes made of hydrocarbon particles.
              Beneath its thick atmosphere, the moon has a solid icy surface and
              possibly an internal ocean of liquid water, suggesting potential
              conditions for life. Exploration of Titan has been primarily
              through NASA’s Cassini-Huygens mission. In 2005, the Huygens probe
              descended to the surface, sending back invaluable data, while
              Cassini orbited Saturn, studying Titan’s atmosphere and surface.
              Titan is of great interest to scientists due to its complex
              chemistry, which may offer insights into prebiotic conditions, and
              it remains a primary target for future missions like NASA’s
              Dragonfly, which is set to launch in the 2030s to explore Titan’s
              surface directly.

              Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and one of the two "ice
              giants" in the solar system, alongside Neptune. It is unique for
              its extreme axial tilt—about 98 degrees—causing its poles to lie
              almost in the plane of its orbit. This results in extreme seasonal
              variations, with each pole experiencing long periods of continuous
              sunlight or darkness. Uranus is composed primarily of hydrogen,
              helium, and water, ammonia, and methane ices, giving it its
              blue-green color. It has a faint ring system and 27 known moons.
              The planet’s atmosphere is mainly hydrogen and helium, with traces
              of methane, which contribute to its distinct hue. Uranus has a
              relatively low internal heat output compared to other giant
              planets, which makes its weather patterns less intense, but still
              dynamic, with high-speed winds and storms. The planet was first
              discovered in 1781 by William Herschel, and although it has been
              visited only once, by Voyager 2 in 1986, Uranus remains a target
              for future exploration, offering potential insights into planetary
              formation and the conditions of ice giants.

              Look up into a clear night sky with your naked eye, what planets
              would you see? Technically you'd be able to see all of them at one
              time or another. All of them, apart from Neptune. It is the
              smallest of the gas giants, and also the farthest away. And it is
              a perplexing place. You would think a planet so far from the sun
              wouldn't have a dynamic atmosphere that exhibits ginormous storms
              and super fast winds. And yet, it does. Neptune is the only planet
              found through mathematical prediction. When Uranus was discovered
              and astronomers were plotting its orbit, they noticed that Uranus
              wasn't following their models. From the perturbed orbit of Uranus,
              Urbain Le Verrier in 1846 concluded that there must be another
              undiscovered planet, and he predicted where it should be. And
              remarkably, Johann Galle was able to find it only a degree away
              from the predicted point. It orbits at 30 astronomical units from
              the sun on average. 30 AUs in other words, is 4.47 billion
              kilometers. 4.5 billion kilometers is a considerable distance.
              Because of this long orbit, it takes a huge 165 years to orbit the
              sun once, which means we've only seen 1 neptunian year since its
              discovery.
